# CARLS

Everything Carleton, now in your pocket.

This is an Expo project supported by TypeScript and React Native.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html#getting-started) (the front-end to our dev environment)

   ```sh
   brew install mise
   ```

3. Build the app

   ```sh
   mise run ios
   ```

4. Start the dev server (this replaces step 3 if you've built and ran the app previously)

   ```sh
   mise run start:ios
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
